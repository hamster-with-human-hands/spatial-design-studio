# Project Description
The project aimed to enhance social connections among AMD employees by transforming underutilised spaces in the auditorium and canteen. Designing modular, portable group discussion zones in the auditorium and a rectangular main dining area in the canteen aimed to encourage human interaction. Pioneering Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) facilitated innovative solutions while reducing resource usage. Human intervention ensured practicality in proposed designs. The project established a standardised workflow for generating 2D images from text and image prompts, but faced challenges in creating 3D perspectives. A dual approach used Generative AI for style validation and Rhino for functionality verification. Challenges due to limited architectural training and technology limitations drove a vision for future work leveraging emerging AI tools to streamline design processes. In summary, the project demonstrated the collaboration between Design Thinking and Generative AI, presenting innovative designs for AMD's spaces and highlighting potential transformative impacts in interior design industries.
